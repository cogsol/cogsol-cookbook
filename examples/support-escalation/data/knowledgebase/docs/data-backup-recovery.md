# Data Backup and Recovery

Guidelines for protecting your work data and recovering lost files.

## Automatic Backups

All company laptops are configured with automatic backups:

- OneDrive: Your Desktop, Documents, and Pictures folders sync automatically.
- Network drives: Backed up nightly by IT with 30-day retention.
- Email: Exchange Online retains deleted items for 30 days.

## Recovering Deleted Files

### From OneDrive

1. Open OneDrive in your browser at https://onedrive.company.com.
2. Click "Recycle Bin" in the left sidebar.
3. Select the files you want to restore and click "Restore".
4. Files remain in the Recycle Bin for 93 days.

### From Network Drives

1. Navigate to the folder where the file was stored.
2. Right-click the folder and select "Properties".
3. Go to the "Previous Versions" tab.
4. Select a version from before the deletion and click "Restore".

### From Email

1. In Outlook, go to Deleted Items.
2. If not there, go to "Recover Deleted Items" in the Folder tab.
3. Select the items and click "Recover Selected Items".

## Best Practices

- Save important files to OneDrive or network drives, not just the local C: drive.
- Do not store sensitive data on USB drives or personal cloud services.
- Regularly check that OneDrive sync is running (cloud icon in system tray).
- For large datasets, contact IT to set up a dedicated backup schedule.

## Data Loss Beyond Recovery

If you have lost data that cannot be recovered through the methods above, submit a ticket immediately. IT may be able to recover from server-level backups, but timing is critical. Include the file name, approximate date of loss, and the original file location.
