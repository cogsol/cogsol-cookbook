# Software Licenses and Installation

How to request, install, and manage software on company devices.

## Pre-Approved Software

The following software is available in Software Center for self-service installation:

- Microsoft Office 365 (included with your account)
- Adobe Acrobat Reader
- Google Chrome / Mozilla Firefox
- 7-Zip
- Notepad++
- Visual Studio Code
- Slack (for external partner communication)
- Zoom (for external meetings only)

Open Software Center from the Start menu, find the application, and click Install.

## Requesting New Software

For software not in Software Center:

1. Go to https://helpdesk.company.com > Service Catalog > Software Requests.
2. Provide the software name, version, business justification, and vendor website.
3. IT Security reviews the request (1-2 business days for standard, 5 days for complex).
4. If approved, IT installs the software or adds it to Software Center.
5. You receive a notification when the software is ready.

## License Types

- Per-user licenses: Tied to your account, work on any company device.
- Per-device licenses: Tied to a specific computer, shared by all users of that machine.
- Floating licenses: Shared pool; connect to the license server to check out a license.

## Compliance

- Do not install personal or unlicensed software on company devices.
- Do not share license keys with colleagues; each user must have their own.
- Report unused licenses to IT so they can be reassigned.
- Annual license audits are conducted by IT; ensure your installed software is authorized.

## Common Issues

### "License expired" Error

Your license may need renewal. Contact IT with the software name and error message. Do not attempt to enter a new key without IT approval.

### Software Center Installation Fails

1. Check that your device is connected to the corporate network (VPN if remote).
2. Restart Software Center.
3. If the issue persists, restart your computer and try again.
4. Submit a ticket if the installation continues to fail.
