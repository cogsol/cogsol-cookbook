# Security Best Practices

Essential security guidelines for all employees.

## Password Policy

- Minimum 12 characters with uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character.
- Change passwords every 90 days.
- Never reuse passwords across systems.
- Use the company-approved password manager (available in Software Center).
- Never share your password with anyone, including IT staff.

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

MFA is required for all corporate systems. Setup:

1. Install Microsoft Authenticator on your phone.
2. Go to https://mysignins.microsoft.com/security-info.
3. Click "Add sign-in method" and select "Authenticator app".
4. Scan the QR code with the Authenticator app.
5. Complete the verification.

If you lose access to your MFA device, contact the Help Desk with a valid photo ID.

## Phishing Awareness

- Do not click links in unexpected emails, even from known senders.
- Verify the sender's email address carefully (look for misspellings).
- Hover over links to check the actual URL before clicking.
- Report suspicious emails using the "Report Phishing" button in Outlook.
- IT will never ask for your password via email.

## Device Security

- Lock your computer when stepping away (Win+L).
- Enable full disk encryption (BitLocker should be active by default).
- Keep your operating system and applications updated.
- Do not install unapproved software.
- Do not connect personal USB devices to work computers.

## Incident Reporting

If you suspect a security incident:

1. Do not attempt to investigate on your own.
2. Disconnect the affected device from the network (unplug Ethernet or disable Wi-Fi).
3. Call the IT emergency line: +1 (555) 911-HELP.
4. Email security@company.com with a description of what happened.
5. Preserve any evidence (do not delete emails or files involved).
