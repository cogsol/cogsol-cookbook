How to use Microsoft Teams for video calls and meetings.

## Starting a Meeting

## Meeting Best Practices

- Join meetings 1-2 minutes early to test audio and video.
- Use a headset for better audio quality.
- Mute yourself when not speaking to reduce background noise.
- Use the "Raise Hand" feature instead of interrupting.
- Share your screen using the "Share" button in the meeting toolbar.

## Troubleshooting Audio Issues

If others cannot hear you:

1. Click the three dots (...) in the meeting toolbar, select "Device settings".
2. Check that the correct microphone is selected.
3. Speak and verify the microphone meter moves.
4. If using a headset, check that it is not muted via its hardware button.
5. Close other applications that might be using the microphone.

## Troubleshooting Video Issues

If your camera is not working:

1. Check that no other application is using the camera (close Zoom, Skype, etc.).
2. In Device settings, verify the correct camera is selected.
3. Check that your camera is not physically blocked or covered.
4. Restart Teams if the camera preview is black.
5. Update your camera driver via Device Manager if the issue persists.

## Meeting Room Equipment

Conference rooms are equipped with Teams Rooms devices:

1. Walk into the room; the display shows a "Join" button for scheduled meetings.
2. Tap "Join" on the touch panel.
3. Use the room camera and speaker system for the call.
4. To share content, connect via HDMI or use "Share to Room" in Teams.
