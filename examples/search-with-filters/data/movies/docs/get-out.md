# Get Out

A chilling horror film with sharp social commentary. Chris Washington, a young Black photographer, visits his white girlfriend's family estate for a weekend getaway. At first, the family's overly accommodating behavior seems like nervous attempts to deal with their daughter's interracial relationship. But as unsettling events pile up and the estate's Black servants behave strangely, Chris realizes something deeply sinister is at work. A tense, original thriller that uses horror to explore racism and cultural appropriation.
