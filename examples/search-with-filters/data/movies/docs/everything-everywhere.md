# Everything Everywhere All at Once

A wildly inventive action film about a Chinese-American immigrant caught up in a multiverse adventure. Evelyn Wang, an exhausted laundromat owner facing an IRS audit and family tensions, discovers she can access the skills and memories of her counterparts in parallel universes. She must use this power to fight a mysterious force that threatens to destroy all of reality. Beneath the chaotic action and absurd humor lies a deeply emotional story about family, regret, and the choices that define who we are.
