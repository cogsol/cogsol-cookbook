A gripping Korean thriller about class and deception. The impoverished Kim family schemes their way into employment with the wealthy Park family, each member taking on a different role in the household. What begins as a darkly comedic con gradually escalates into something far more dangerous as secrets are uncovered and tensions between the two families reach a breaking point. A sharp social commentary that shifts genres seamlessly, from comedy to suspense to horror.
