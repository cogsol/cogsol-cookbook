# Travel Approval Workflow

## Approval Thresholds

### Self-Approval
- Total trip cost under EUR 500: no approval required (must still follow all policies)
- Domestic day trips: no approval required

### Manager Approval
- Total trip cost between EUR 500 and EUR 2,000
- Any domestic overnight trip
- Last-minute bookings (under 48 hours before departure)

### Director Approval
- Total trip cost between EUR 2,000 and EUR 5,000
- Any international trip
- Trips exceeding 5 business days

### VP Approval
- Total trip cost exceeding EUR 5,000
- Trips exceeding 10 business days
- Any trip requiring Business class flights for non-eligible staff

## Process
1. Submit travel request in the corporate travel portal at least 7 days before departure
2. Include: destination, dates, purpose, estimated budget breakdown
3. Approver has 48 hours to respond
4. If no response within 48 hours, escalate to the next level
5. Approved requests are valid for 30 days from approval date

## Emergency Travel
- For urgent unplanned travel, obtain verbal approval from your manager
- Submit formal request within 24 hours of return
- Emergency travel still requires receipt documentation

## Group Travel
- Trips with 3 or more employees to the same destination require director approval
- Groups of 5 or more require VP approval regardless of cost
