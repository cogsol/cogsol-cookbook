Tender pieces of marinated chicken cooked in a rich, spiced tomato and cream sauce. One of the most popular Indian-inspired dishes worldwide, perfect served over basmati rice or with warm naan bread.

## Ingredients

- 600g boneless chicken thighs, cut into chunks
- 200ml plain yogurt
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 2 teaspoons paprika
- 1 teaspoon garam masala
- 1 teaspoon turmeric
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, grated
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 large onion, finely diced

4. Add the crushed tomatoes and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
