# Banana Pancakes

Fluffy, naturally sweet pancakes made with ripe bananas. A wholesome breakfast that uses simple pantry ingredients. Kids love them, and they are a great way to use overripe bananas.

## Ingredients

- 2 ripe bananas, mashed
- 2 large eggs
- 150g all-purpose flour
- 120ml milk
- 2 tablespoons melted butter, plus extra for cooking
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- Pinch of salt
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

### Toppings
- Maple syrup
- Fresh berries (blueberries, strawberries)
- Sliced banana
- Whipped cream
- Chopped walnuts

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, mash the bananas with a fork until mostly smooth with a few small lumps.
2. Add the eggs, milk, melted butter, sugar, and vanilla extract. Whisk until well combined.
3. In a separate bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.
4. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients. Stir until just combined. A few lumps are fine; do not overmix or the pancakes will be tough.
5. Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Add a small pat of butter.
6. Pour about 60ml of batter per pancake onto the skillet. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2 minutes.
7. Flip and cook for another 1 minute until golden brown.
8. Serve stacked with your choice of toppings.
