# Grilled Salmon with Herbs

Fresh salmon fillets marinated in lemon, garlic, and herbs, then grilled to perfection. The fish stays moist and flavorful with a slightly crispy exterior. A healthy and elegant main course.

## Ingredients

- 4 salmon fillets (about 180g each), skin on
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh dill, chopped
- 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Lemon wedges for serving

## Instructions

1. In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, dill, parsley, oregano, salt, and pepper.
2. Place the salmon fillets in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over them. Let sit for 15 minutes at room temperature.
3. Preheat the grill to medium-high heat. Lightly oil the grill grates.
4. Place the salmon skin-side down on the grill. Cook for 4 minutes without moving.
5. Carefully flip the fillets and cook for another 3 minutes until the fish flakes easily with a fork and reaches an internal temperature of 63C.
6. Remove from the grill and let rest for 2 minutes.
7. Serve with lemon wedges and your choice of sides: steamed vegetables, rice, or a green salad.
