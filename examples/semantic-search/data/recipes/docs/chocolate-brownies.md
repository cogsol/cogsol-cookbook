# Chocolate Brownies

Fudgy, rich chocolate brownies with a crackly top and an intensely chocolatey center. Made with real melted chocolate and cocoa powder for deep flavor. Perfect for dessert or an afternoon treat.

## Ingredients

- 200g dark chocolate (70% cocoa), chopped
- 150g unsalted butter
- 200g sugar
- 3 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 80g all-purpose flour
- 30g unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 100g walnuts or pecans, roughly chopped (optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 180C. Line a 20x20cm baking pan with parchment paper.
2. Melt the chocolate and butter together in a heatproof bowl over simmering water (double boiler), stirring until smooth. Let cool slightly.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk the sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract until well combined.
4. Pour the melted chocolate mixture into the egg mixture. Stir until smooth.
5. Sift the flour, cocoa powder, and salt into the batter. Fold gently until just combined. Do not overmix.
6. Fold in the nuts if using.
7. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread evenly.
8. Bake for 25 minutes. The center should be slightly soft when tested with a toothpick; it will firm up as it cools.
9. Let cool completely in the pan before cutting into squares.
