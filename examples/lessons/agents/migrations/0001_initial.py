(2) Set up messages: an initial welcome message, a forced termination message for inappropriate queries, and a no-information message for unknown topics. (3) Choose a generation configuration optimized for the task (e.g. QA, complex reasoning, image-based). (4) Adjust parameters: temperature (0-2) controls creativity, max interactions limits the conversation length, message size sets the token limit, and max consecutive tool calls caps recursive LLM calls.', 'meta': {'topic': None, 'context_of_application': 'When the user is setting up a new assistant, configuring its behavior, or asking about prompts, messages, and parameters.'}, 'agent': 'LessonsDocsAgent'}),

(2) Chunking problems: bad segmentation; adjust chunk size, overlap, or separators. (3) Retrieval problems: irrelevant results; apply reranking, date-based reordering, or topic-scoped searches. (4) Context problems: assistant lacks background; use lessons for general context or metadata for document-specific context. (5) Flow problems: poor interaction style; adjust the system prompt or add FAQs. (6) Generation problems: reasoning errors; switch models or prompting techniques.
