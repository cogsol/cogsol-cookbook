# Mexico City, Mexico

A sprawling capital built on the ruins of the Aztec empire, offering world-class museums, vibrant markets, and some of the best food on the planet.

## Overview

Mexico City, often called CDMX, is the capital of Mexico and one of the largest metropolitan areas in the Western Hemisphere. Built on the site of the ancient Aztec capital Tenochtitlan, the city layers pre-Columbian history, colonial architecture, and modern urban culture. Its high-altitude location at 2,240 meters gives it a mild climate year-round.

## Top Attractions

- **Zócalo**: The vast main square surrounded by the Metropolitan Cathedral and the National Palace with Diego Rivera murals.
- **National Museum of Anthropology**: One of the world's great museums, showcasing Aztec, Maya, and other Mesoamerican civilizations.
- **Chapultepec Castle**: A hilltop castle in the middle of Chapultepec Park with panoramic city views.
- **Coyoacán**: A charming neighborhood home to the Frida Kahlo Museum (Casa Azul) and leafy plazas.
- **Xochimilco**: Ancient canals where colorful trajinera boats carry visitors past floating gardens.

## Local Cuisine

Mexico City is a food lover's dream. Start with tacos al pastor from a street stand, try tamales for breakfast, enjoy mole sauces over chicken, and sample tlacoyos (stuffed corn cakes) at a market. Churros with chocolate, elote (grilled corn with mayo, chili, and cheese), and fresh aguas frescas complete the experience. The city also has a thriving fine dining scene with restaurants like Pujol on the world's best lists.

## Best Time to Visit

March to May offers warm and dry conditions ideal for exploring. The rainy season from June to October brings brief afternoon showers but keeps the city green. November to February is cool and dry with occasional chilly nights.

## Travel Tips

- Use the Metro, Metrobús, or ride-hailing apps to navigate the sprawling city efficiently.
- Drink bottled water and be cautious with street ice and unpeeled produce.
- Sundays are perfect for visiting: many museums are free, and Paseo de la Reforma closes to traffic for cyclists and pedestrians.
- The altitude can cause mild symptoms for some visitors; stay hydrated and take it easy on your first day.
- Mexico City is generally safe for tourists, but stay aware in crowded areas and avoid flashing valuables.
