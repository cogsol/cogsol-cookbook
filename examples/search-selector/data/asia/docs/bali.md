# Bali, Indonesia

An island paradise of terraced rice paddies, sacred temples, world-class surfing, and a deeply spiritual culture.

## Overview

Bali is an Indonesian island in the Lesser Sunda Islands chain. Unlike the rest of predominantly Muslim Indonesia, Bali is Hindu, giving it a unique cultural identity expressed through daily offerings, temple ceremonies, and colorful festivals. From lush jungle interiors to stunning coastlines, the island offers extraordinary natural beauty.

## Top Attractions

- **Uluwatu Temple**: A clifftop sea temple with dramatic sunset views and nightly Kecak fire dance performances.
- **Tegallalang Rice Terraces**: Iconic stepped rice paddies near Ubud showcasing traditional Balinese irrigation.
- **Ubud**: The cultural heart of Bali with art galleries, monkey forests, and yoga retreats.
- **Seminyak**: A trendy beach area known for upscale restaurants, boutiques, and sunset beach clubs.
- **Mount Batur**: An active volcano popular for sunrise treks overlooking a caldera lake.

## Local Cuisine

Balinese cuisine is fragrant and flavorful. Must-try dishes include nasi goreng (fried rice), babi guling (suckling pig), sate lilit (minced seafood satay), lawar (mixed vegetable and meat dish with grated coconut), and mie goreng (fried noodles). Warungs, small family-run eateries, serve authentic local food at very affordable prices.

## Best Time to Visit

The dry season from April to October offers the best weather for beach and outdoor activities. July and August are peak tourist months. The wet season from November to March brings afternoon downpours but also greener landscapes and lower prices.

## Travel Tips

- Rent a scooter for flexibility, but always wear a helmet and carry your international driving permit.
- Respect temple etiquette: wear a sarong and sash when entering temples.
- Bargaining is expected at markets but do so respectfully and with a smile.
- Book accommodations in the area that matches your travel style: Ubud for culture, Seminyak for nightlife, Canggu for surfing.
- Be cautious with tap water; drink bottled or filtered water only.
