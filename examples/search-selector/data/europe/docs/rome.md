# Rome, Italy

The Eternal City is a living museum where ancient ruins stand alongside Renaissance masterpieces and vibrant street life.

## Overview

Rome is the capital of Italy and one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. Founded in 753 BC, it was the heart of the Roman Empire and later became the center of the Catholic Church. Today it combines millennia of history with a lively modern Italian lifestyle.

## Top Attractions

- **Colosseum**: The largest ancient amphitheater ever built, once hosting gladiatorial contests.
- **Vatican City**: Home to St. Peter's Basilica, the Sistine Chapel, and the Vatican Museums.

- **Roman Forum**: The ruins of the ancient civic center of the Roman Empire.

## Local Cuisine

Roman cuisine is hearty and simple. Try cacio e pepe (pasta with pecorino and black pepper), carbonara, supplì (fried rice balls), and Roman-style pizza al taglio sold by weight. Gelato is available on nearly every corner, and espresso is a daily ritual best enjoyed standing at the bar.

## Best Time to Visit

April to June and September to October offer pleasant weather and manageable crowds. July and August are hot and crowded but have a festive atmosphere. Winter is quiet with shorter lines at major sites.
