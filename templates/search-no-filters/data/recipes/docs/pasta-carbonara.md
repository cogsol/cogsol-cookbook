# Pasta Carbonara

A classic Italian pasta dish made with eggs, cheese, pancetta, and black pepper. Rich, creamy, and comforting without using any cream.

## Ingredients

- 400g spaghetti
- 200g pancetta or guanciale, diced
- 4 large egg yolks
- 1 whole egg
- 100g Pecorino Romano, finely grated
- 50g Parmigiano-Reggiano, finely grated
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Salt for pasta water

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti until al dente.
2. While the pasta cooks, place the pancetta in a cold skillet. Cook over medium heat until the fat renders and the pancetta is crispy, about 8 minutes.
3. In a bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, whole egg, and both cheeses. Add a generous amount of black pepper.
4. When the pasta is ready, reserve one cup of pasta water. Drain the spaghetti and add it to the skillet with the pancetta. Remove from heat.
5. Pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot pasta. Toss quickly, adding splashes of pasta water to create a silky sauce. The residual heat cooks the eggs gently without scrambling them.
6. Serve immediately with extra grated cheese and black pepper on top.
