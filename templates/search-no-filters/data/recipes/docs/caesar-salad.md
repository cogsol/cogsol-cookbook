- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard

### Homemade Croutons (optional)
- 3 cups bread cubes (day-old bread)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil

## Instructions

1. To make the dressing, mash the garlic and anchovies into a paste using a mortar and pestle or the flat side of a knife. Transfer to a bowl.
2. Whisk in the lemon juice, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and egg yolk until smooth.
3. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil while whisking constantly until the dressing is thick and emulsified. Season with salt and pepper.
